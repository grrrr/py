"""This is an example script for the py/pyext object's send/receive functionality.

You can:
- bind


There are several classes exposing py/pyext features:
- ex1: A class receiving messages and sending them out again
- ex2: A class receiving messages and putting them out to an outlet
- ex3: Do some PD scripting

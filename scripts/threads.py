"""This is an example script for the py/pyext object's threading functionality.

For threading support pyext exposes several function and variables

- _detach([0/1]): by enabling thread detaching, threads will run in their own threads
- _priority(prio+-): you can raise or lower the priority of the current thread
- _stop({wait time in ms}): stop all running threads (you can additionally specify a wait time in ms)
- _shouldexit: this is a flag which indicates that the running thread should terminate

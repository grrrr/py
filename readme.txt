----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to have Python installed on your system for the py/pyext external to work.
For Windows pick an up-to-date package from http://www.python.org .
For linux use the package manager. 
For OS X keep things as the are - it has Python installed by default.


The py/pyext package should run with Python version >= 2.1.
It has been tested with versions 2.2 to 2.7

The default build setting using PY_USE_GIL requires Python version >= 2.3.

Check out the sample patches and scripts

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
============

PD version >= 0.38 - Add "py" to the Startup items ("binaries to load") and add the folder "scripts" to the pd search path.
PD version < 0.38 - Load it as a library with e.g. "pd -lib py -path scripts"
Under Windows, py/pyext needs at least PD 0.43

Max/MSP - Copy py-objectmappings.txt into the init folder and py.mxe (Windows) or py.mxo (OSX) into the externals folder.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
===========

With the py object you can load python modules and execute the functions therein.
With the pyext you can use python classes to represent full-featured pd/Max message objects.
Multithreading (detached methods) is supported for both objects.
You can send messages to named objects or receive (with pyext) with Python methods.


Known bugs:
- The TCL/TK help patch is not usable under OSX.
- With standard PD 0.37, threaded py scripts will cause "Stack overflows" under some circumstances
  -> use PD 0.38 or the devel_0_37 cvs branch instead
- It has been reported that pyext crashes on AMD64 with SSE enabled (for these CPUs, disable the respective compiler flags)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILDING from source
====================

You will need the flext C++ layer for PD and Max/MSP externals to compile this.
See http://grrrr.org/ext/flext
Download and unzip, or git-clone the package.


Pure data - any platform supporting gcc-compatible compilers
------------------------------------------------------------

 --> Build with cmake for Python3 support <--

A lot of variables can be set to redirect paths for puredata, flext and python, according to your environment. It is suggested to have a look at the CMakeLists.txt to better understand which variables are used where and what they correspond to.

To build with cmake, run the following commands, replacing the paths and values according to your current environment:
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake .. \
-GNinja \ # optional, builds faster 
-DPYTHON_SHARED_LIB_PATH=/path/to/pythonx.x.so \
-DPATH_TO_PD_EXTERNALS=/path/to/pd/externals \
-DPD_SOURCE_PATH=/path/to/pd/sources \
-DFLEXT_SOURCE_PATH=/path/to/flext/sources \
-DPYTHON_SOURCE_PATH=/path/to/python/sources \
-DPYTHON_VERSION=pythoncurrent.version

------------------------------------------------------------


The pd-lib-builder project (https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder) is used to compile the project.
A git subtree of this project is already present.

The compilation is done using the GNU make tool and it will need additional information about the location of the flext source files, and possibly, Pure data, if a specific version should be used.

This could be an example:
make CPPFLAGS="-I ../flext/source" PDDIR="../../pure-data"

For OS X, further flags can be needed:
CFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.9" LDFLAGS="-mmacosx-version-min=10.9"


pd/Max - Windows - Microsoft Visual C, Borland C++, MinGW:
----------------------------------------------------------
Start a command shell with your eventual build environment
(e.g. run vcvars32.bat for Microsoft Visual Studio)

then run
 ..\flext\build.bat
(you would have to substitute ..\flext with the respective path to the flext package)


pd/Max - OSX/Linux - GCC:
-------------------------
From a shell run
bash ../flext/build.sh
(you would have to substitute ../flext with the respective path to the flext package)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python array support for py/pyext@Max/MSP:

In the Max/MSP SDK change the file 
4.5 headers\c74support\max-includes\ext_types.h, line 45
from 
    typedef unsigned long                    UInt32;
    typedef signed long                      SInt32;
to
    typedef unsigned int                    UInt32;
    typedef signed int                      SInt32;
to avoid a compile-time type definition clash.

Version history:

0.2.2:
- FIX: pyext._send(receiversym) sent an empty list to receiversym, now it sends a bang message (equivalent to pyext._send(receiversym,"bang",()) ). Thanks to Yvan Volochine for spotting that.
- FIX: A bug in Pd < 0.43 under Windows causes various errors on loading the modules. This is fixed, py/pyext for Windows now needs Pd 0.43

0.2.1:
- FIX: some simplifications in py and pyext

- ADD: py can have multiple inlets for multiple function arguments (right inlets are non-triggering)
- ADD: allow module.function syntax for py and pyext
- FIX: pyext: cleanup float vs. int ... first decision is made by tag, afterwards a conversion is tried
- ADD: pym: object-oriented object... Python methods for any object type
- ADD: py: allow all callables (also object constructors and builtins)
- ADD: py: enable Python built-in functions (like range, str etc.)
- ADD: sequence protocol for symbol type
- FIX: cleanup for outbound messages (e.g. symbol atoms instead of one-element general messages)
- FIX: better exception handling (no longer leaves reference to function object) and cleared misleading error message
